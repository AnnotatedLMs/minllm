# Instruction Tuning

## Overview
Instruction tuning is the process of fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) to follow natural language instructions, improving their ability to perform diverse tasks in a user-friendly manner.

## Development of Instruction Tuning

### Phase 1: Early Approaches (2020-2021)
**GPT-3** demonstrated initial capabilities:
- **Language Models are Few-Shot Learners** (2020) - Brown et al. (OpenAI)
  - https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165
  - Showed that large models could follow task descriptions in prompts without explicit instruction tuning
  - Revealed latent instruction-following abilities in large-scale language models

**First dedicated instruction tuning work**:
- **Finetuned Language Models Are Zero-Shot Learners (FLAN)** (2021) - Wei et al. (Google)
  - https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.01652
  - Fine-tuned on 62 NLP tasks with natural language instructions
  - Improved zero-shot performance on unseen tasks

- **Multitask Prompted Training Enables Zero-Shot Task Generalization (T0)** (2021) - Sanh et al. (BigScience)
  - https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08207
  - Used prompted versions of existing datasets
  - Focused on systematic evaluation of instruction following

**Key finding**: Fine-tuning on diverse tasks with natural language instructions improved generalization to new tasks.

### Phase 2: Scaling and Integration with RLHF (2022)

**InstructGPT** combined instruction tuning with human feedback:
- **Training language models to follow instructions with human feedback** (2022) - Ouyang et al. (OpenAI)
  - https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02155
  - Combined supervised fine-tuning on human demonstrations with RLHF
  - Used 13K instruction-following demonstrations
  - Reduced harmful outputs while improving helpfulness

**Scaling instruction diversity**:
- **Super-NaturalInstructions** (2022) - Wang et al.
  - https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.07705
  - Collection of 1,600+ NLP tasks with expert-written instructions
  - Systematic study of instruction diversity effects

- **Scaling Instruction-Finetuned Language Models** (2022) - Chung et al. (Google)
  - https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11416
  - Scaled FLAN to 1,800+ tasks (FLAN-T5, FLAN-PaLM)
  - Mixed different instruction formats and datasets
  - Integrated chain-of-thought reasoning

**Technical insight**: Increasing task count and diversity improved performance, with diminishing returns after ~100 tasks.

### Phase 3: Synthetic Data and Open Models (2023)

**Self-Instruct** introduced synthetic data generation:
- **Self-Instruct: Aligning Language Model with Self Generated Instructions** (2022) - Wang et al.
  - https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10560
  - Used GPT-3 to generate instruction-following examples
  - Bootstrap approach starting from 175 seed tasks

**Alpaca** applied this to open models:
- **Alpaca: A Strong, Replicable Instruction-Following Model** (2023) - Taori et al. (Stanford)
  - https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca
  - 52K GPT-generated examples applied to LLaMA-7B
  - Demonstrated effectiveness of synthetic data at small scale

**LLaMA models** provided foundation for instruction tuning:
- **LLaMA: Open and Efficient Foundation Language Models** (2023) - Touvron et al. (Meta)
  - https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13971
  - Base models that became standard for instruction tuning experiments
  - LLaMA-2-Chat included Meta's own instruction tuning

### Phase 4: Data Quality Focus (2023-2024)

**LIMA** examined minimal data requirements:
- **LIMA: Less Is More for Alignment** (2023) - Zhou et al. (Meta)
  - https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11206
  - 1,000 carefully curated examples
  - Comparable performance to models trained on 50K+ examples

  - Fully documented instruction tuning process
  - Released training data and implementation details
  - Mixed human-written and synthetic instructions

  - Incorporated step-by-step reasoning formats

## Key Technical Details

### Data Collection Methods
1. **Human annotations**: Manual creation of instruction-output pairs (InstructGPT, LIMA)
2. **Synthetic generation**: Using existing models to create data (Alpaca, Self-Instruct)
3. **Dataset conversion**: Reformatting existing NLP datasets with instructions (FLAN, T0)
4. **User logs**: Mining real user-assistant interactions (as used in some commercial models)

### Instruction Formats
- **Basic templates**: "Translate to French: [text]"
- **Detailed specifications**: Multi-sentence descriptions with constraints
- **Few-shot examples**: Instructions with input-output demonstrations
- **Chain-of-thought**: Instructions requesting step-by-step reasoning

### Training Considerations
- **Data mixing**: Balancing different task types and domains
- **Format consistency**: Standardizing instruction templates
- **Length calibration**: Avoiding biases toward verbose outputs
- **Safety preservation**: Maintaining model safety during instruction tuning

## Practical Considerations

### Data Requirements
- **Minimum viable dataset**: ~1K high-quality examples (LIMA)
- **Typical scale**: 10K-100K examples for robust performance
- **Diminishing returns**: Limited gains beyond 100-200 unique task types

### Common Challenges
- **Overfitting to format**: Models becoming too rigid in expected input structure
- **Knowledge degradation**: Loss of pre-training capabilities
- **Inconsistent quality**: Variable performance across task types
- **Evaluation gaps**: Difficulty measuring true instruction-following ability

### Current Practices
- **Multi-stage training**: Pre-training → Instruction tuning → RLHF
- **Data filtering**: Removing low-quality or harmful examples
- **Balanced mixing**: Careful proportions of different task types
- **Held-out evaluation**: Testing on genuinely novel task formats
