# Mixture of Experts in Large Language Models

## Overview
Mixture of Experts (MoE) represents a conditional computation approach where different subsets of model parameters (experts) are activated for different inputs. This enables scaling model capacity without proportionally increasing computational cost, as only a fraction of parameters are active for any given input.

## Development Timeline

### Phase 1: Classical Foundation (1991-1994)
**Core concept**: Multiple specialized networks (experts) are combined through a gating mechanism that learns to route inputs to appropriate experts based on input characteristics.

**Key characteristics**:
- Probabilistic routing through softmax gating
- Local specialization of experts
- EM algorithm for training
- Applied to small-scale problems

### Phase 2: Modern Deep Learning Integration (2017-2022)
**Core concept**: MoE layers integrated into transformer architectures, enabling unprecedented scale through sparse activation patterns and distributed training infrastructure.

**Key characteristics**:
- Sparse gating with top-k routing
- Distributed training across thousands of cores
- Load balancing auxiliary losses
- Trillion-parameter scale achieved

**Outrageously Large Neural Networks: The Sparsely-Gated Mixture-of-Experts Layer** (2017) - Shazeer et al.
- https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.06538
- Brought MoE to modern NLP
- 137B parameters with conditional computation
- Introduced noisy top-k gating

Following this breakthrough, the field diverged into two primary directions for scaling MoE architectures:

#### Infrastructure-Focused Scaling
These approaches pushed the absolute limits of model size, focusing on distributed systems engineering to handle hundreds of billions to trillions of parameters across massive compute clusters.

**GShard** (2020) - Google
- https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.16668
- Scaled to 600B parameters
- Efficient parallelization strategies

**Switch Transformers** (2021) - Google
- https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.03961
- Simplified to single expert routing
- Scaled to 1.6T parameters
- Improved training stability

#### Efficiency-Focused Methods
In contrast to pure scaling, these methods focused on making MoE more practical through improved training dynamics, better compute efficiency, and enhanced transfer learning capabilities.

**GLaM** (2021) - Google
- https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.06905
- 1.2T parameters
- More compute-efficient than dense models

**ST-MoE** (2022) - Google
- https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.08906
- Focused on training stability
- Improved transfer learning capabilities

### Phase 3: Production-Ready Models (2023-2025)
**Core concept**: MoE transitions from research curiosity to production deployment, with open-source releases and architectural innovations that balance performance with practical constraints.

**Key characteristics**:
- Open-source model releases
- Fine-grained expert specialization
- Novel routing mechanisms
- Integration with other techniques (e.g., latent attention)

Two parallel movements emerged as MoE matured into production systems:

#### Open Models
These releases made MoE accessible beyond major tech companies, providing complete training recipes and model weights to accelerate community innovation.

- Fully open development process

#### Production Architectures
While open-source efforts focused on accessibility, these approaches pushed the boundaries of MoE design through novel routing mechanisms, expert granularity, and integration with complementary techniques.

### Phase 4: Multimodal and Specialized Applications (2021-2024)
**Core concept**: MoE extends beyond language to handle multiple modalities and specialized domains, with experts learning cross-modal and domain-specific representations.

**Key characteristics**:
- Cross-modal expert specialization
- Unified architectures for multiple inputs
- Long-context processing capabilities
- Domain-specific routing patterns

The expansion to multimodal applications revealed distinct strategies for leveraging expert specialization across modalities:

#### Vision-First Integration
These approaches began with vision transformers and added MoE layers, demonstrating that conditional computation benefits extend beyond language tasks.
